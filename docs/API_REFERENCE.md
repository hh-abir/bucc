# API Reference

The BUCC Web Portal utilizes Next.js Route Handlers (`src/app/api/...`) to construct a secure REST API. All sensitive endpoints enforce server-side validation against both the user's session role and the global system configuration.

## System Configuration (`/api/config`)

Manages global state, including recruitment lifecycle gatekeepers and dynamic UI content like the Hero Carousel.

### `GET /api/config`
Retrieves a configuration value by key.
- **Query Params:** `?key=[config_key]` (e.g., `recruitment_config`, `hero_carousel_config`)
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "key": "recruitment_config",
    "value": {
      "isRegistrationOpen": false,
      "registrationTargetDate": "2026-09-01T10:00"
    }
  }
  ```

### `POST /api/config`
Updates configuration. Restricted to Governing Body, HR, and R&D.
- **Payload:** `{ key: string, value: any }`
- **Security:** Checks `isGoverningBody` or `isRDAdmin` for sensitive keys.

## Member Showcase (`/api/projects`)

Manages the BUCC Project Showcase.

### `GET /api/projects`
- **Public:** `?status=approved` (Returns only approved projects for the gallery).
- **Featured Showcase:** `?status=approved&featured=true` (Returns only approved projects marked as featured for the landing page).
- **Admin:** Can fetch pending/rejected projects for the moderation queue.
- **Detail:** `?id=[id]` or `?slug=[slug]` fetches a single project.

### `POST /api/projects`
- **Submits a new project.**
- **Payload:** `{ title, coverImage, shortDescription, fullDescription, techStack, contributors, deploymentLink, sourceCodeLink }`
- **Auth:** Requires any active session. Admins auto-approve; members set to `pending`.

### `PATCH /api/projects`
- **Updates project content, status, or featured toggle.**
- **Payload Parameters:** Supports updating content fields (`title`, `shortDescription`, etc.), status (`approved`, `rejected`), or `isFeatured` (boolean).
- **Auth & Access Constraints:** 
  - Admins (GB/R&D AD/Directors) can edit any project content or update status.
  - Members can only edit their own `pending` projects (once approved, they cannot edit content).
  - Toggling `isFeatured` is strictly restricted to **Governing Body (GB)** and **R&D Admin** (`isSuperUser`) members. Attempting to toggle it without these roles returns `403 Forbidden`.

- **Cache Invalidation:** Any successful `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` request automatically triggers Next.js cache revalidation for the home page `/`, the gallery list page `/projects`, and the specific project slug page `/projects/[slug]` on-demand, ensuring changes are immediately reflected.
